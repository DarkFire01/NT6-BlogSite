    <h2> The_DarkFire_'s NT6+ Blog </h2>
    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I am contributor to the ReactOS project; I've implemented features such as xHCI and UEFI support
        But I have an insanely large facination with modern windows. To those who don't know ReactOS is
        a open source operating system designed to be binary compatible with the Windows NT line of OSes
        be essentially being a clone of windows made with reverse engineering. Currently targetting NT5.2
    </p>
    <h1>So what is this?</h1>
    <p>
        This blog is a place to document all of the interesting information I find out about how modern
        windows works. My goal is to get modern software support into ReactOS and understanding a large 
        plethera of NT6+ APIs.
